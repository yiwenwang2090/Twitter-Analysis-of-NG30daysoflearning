# Introduction
Story telling with PowerBi by [Paul](https://twitter.com/PauloDaguvnor?s=20&t=vZLxXH6n6up00sT6dPJaLw) was taught in Day 15 and 16 of the NG30daysoflearning.
This is to show what I learnt in this class

# Problem Statement
@theoyinbooke made an announcement on [twitter](https://twitter.com/TheOyinbooke/status/1523694387770789888?s=20&t=vZLxXH6n6up00sT6dPJaLw) May 9, 2022 about the NG30daysoflearning. From then till now there has been series of engagemnts with the hashtag on twitter with participants showcasing what they have learnt and many more

With everything I have learnt in this training, I want to show an analysis of the engagement of the hashtag which will be useful to the organisers and other interested parties

After taking a look at the [dataset](https://aka.ms/30DLDATGitHubRepo) made available. I decided to ask this questions
1. What day of the week were participants most active?
2. What time of the day were participants most active?
3. Who are the most active participants?
4. What were the top most liked and retweeted post?
5. What were the top locations of our participants?

# My Thought Process
I am sure you will be wondering why this questions, what insight do you want to show, what do you want to call our attention to and many more. This is what i was thinking while asking this question,
### What day of the week were participants most active ? 
- I am interested in finding out what was happening on this particular day, what makes it different from every other day, is there something the organisers are doing on this said day that they aren't doing on other days? This dataset can't give this answers but it has opened a new light the organisers can carry out a survey to look at.
### What time of the day were participants most active ? 
- I want to find out why engagement is higher at this time, are the partcipants busy with other things before then, can there be a way to adjust the programme to fit this time, or are the organisers doing something at this time we have to take note of 
### Who are the most active participants ?
- My major question here is, Is the active participants the actual learners or the organisers? 
### What were the top most liked and retweeted post ?
- To know if there is a pattern among the top posts the organisers should take note of, they can use this to make an informed decision what type of post they will be putting out
### what were the top locations of our participants?
- I asked this just incase the organisers wants to have a data hang out or create a physcial hub.
